# Kiwi.JS-Demonstration

This repository contains the files needed in order to understand our Kiwi.JS tutorial.

It contains the Match Three Code used in the tutorial, the starter/finished Platform example, as well as the version of Kiwi.JS we used for this project.

This project was created for the University of Washington's Autumn 2015 Informatics 343: Client-Side Web Development course.
