The Platformer Blueprint is an easy to use blueprint for Kiwi.js that you can include to rapidly develop a platforming Kiwi game.

A platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms, over obstacles, or both to advance the game. These challenges are known as jumping puzzles or freerunning. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps.

This Blueprint allows users to rapidly develop a platforming game. This repository is in active development and should be updated almost daily until we release an official version. 

##Features

* Tile map Creation (Tiled support)
